~~Unfortunately, I found MySQL wasn't installed on the PC I'm using.~~
~~So I had to install MySQL before starting the lab. TT~~

- I gonna change some lines about the connection to MySQL.
- also, some variables need to be added to the `.env` file.

23:11
- my app couldn't connect to MySQL
- it still used SQLite!! TT

23:15
- It seems I forgot some dependencies.
- ai agent is helping me install them.

23:22
- It's confirmed: the problem was missing dependencies.
- now the app's database is MySQL. 
- only 10 minutes taken 
- great ai!

23:37
- previous functions still work.
- everything seems alright (I hope so~).
- I'm gonna sleep after I commit and push.
- wish the deployment step goes as smoothly as step one.
- good night world.

23:52
- my .md doesn't perform as I expected
- try again
