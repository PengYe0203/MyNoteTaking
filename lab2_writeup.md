my app couldn't connect to mysql
it still used sqlite!!
TT

23:15
it seems that I forgot some dependencies
ai agent is helping me install these dependencies

23:22
it has confirmed that the point is dependencies
now this database of this app is MySQL
only 10 minutes is taken
great ai!

23:37
those functions implemented before can still work
everything seems to be alright (I hope so~)
I gonna sleep after I commit and push
wish the step of deploying can as smooth as step one
good night world
